# Codecov Onboarding Skill

This skill helps developers onboard their repositories to Codecov for unit test coverage tracking. It guides users through the entire process: analyzing their repository, configuring coverage uploads with proper flags, and setting up CI integration.

## What is Codecov?

Codecov is a code coverage reporting service that:
1. Collects coverage reports from your CI pipelines
2. Provides visibility into test coverage trends
3. Comments on PRs with coverage changes
4. Supports multiple coverage flags to separate unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks to onboard their repository to Codecov
- Wants to add unit test coverage reporting
- Needs to configure coverage uploads with flags
- Mentions integrating Codecov with GitHub Actions, OpenShift CI, or GitLab CI
- Wants to add coverage tracking to their existing test pipeline

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, verify:
- User has an existing repository with unit tests already running
- User has access to Codecov (https://app.codecov.io)
- User knows which CI system runs their unit tests

## Instructions

### Step 0: Pre-Onboarding Assessment

Before starting, ask the user these questions and wait for responses:

```
I'll help you onboard your repository to Codecov. Let me start with a few questions:

1. **Codecov Account**: Have you signed up at https://app.codecov.io using your GitHub/GitLab account?
   - If NO: Please sign up first, then come back.

2. **Upstream vs Fork**: Are you onboarding the upstream (main) repository or a personal fork?
   - ⚠️ **Important:** You should onboard the **upstream repository**, not your fork.
   - Coverage should be tracked on the main project where PRs are merged.
   - Forks inherit coverage data from the upstream repo automatically.
   - If you only have a fork, coordinate with the upstream maintainers to onboard the main repo.

3. **Repository Added**: Is the upstream repository already added to Codecov?
   - If NO: Go to Codecov → Your Org → Click "Configure" on the repo to add it.

4. **Upload Token**: Do you have your Codecov upload token ready?
   - Repository token: Found in Codecov UI → Your Repo → Configure → "Step 3: add token"
   - Global token: Organization Settings → Global Upload Token (requires org admin)

5. **CI System**: Which CI system runs your unit tests?
   - GitHub Actions
   - OpenShift CI (Prow)
   - GitLab CI
   - Other (please specify)

6. **Existing Coverage**: Do you already have any Codecov setup (even partial)?
   - If YES: What's currently configured? (helps me understand what needs updating)
```

Wait for user responses before proceeding.

### Step 1: Analyze the Repository

Scan the repository to understand the current setup:

1. **Detect programming language(s):**
   ```bash
   # Check for language indicators
   ls -la go.mod package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml setup.py pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. **Find test configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Check Makefile for test targets
   grep -E "^test|^unit|^coverage" Makefile 2>/dev/null
   # Check package.json scripts
   grep -A20 '"scripts"' package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -i test
   ```

3. **Check for existing Codecov setup:**
   ```bash
   # Look for codecov configuration
   ls -la codecov.yml .codecov.yml 2>/dev/null
   grep -r "codecov" .github/workflows/ --include="*.yml" --include="*.yaml" 2>/dev/null
   grep -r "codecov\|CODECOV" .tekton/ --include="*.yaml" 2>/dev/null
   grep -r "codecov" .gitlab-ci.yml 2>/dev/null
   ```

4. **Find CI configuration:**
   ```bash
   # GitHub Actions
   ls .github/workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/*.yaml 2>/dev/null
   # OpenShift CI - ask user for prow config link
   # GitLab CI
   ls .gitlab-ci.yml 2>/dev/null
   ```

Present findings to the user:

```
I've analyzed your repository. Here's what I found:

**Language(s):** [detected languages]
**Test command:** [if found in Makefile/package.json/etc.]
**CI System:** [detected CI files]
**Existing Codecov setup:** [None / Partial - describe what exists]

Is this correct? Please confirm or let me know if I missed anything.
```

Wait for user confirmation.

### Step 2: Handle Partial Codecov Setup

If the repository already has some Codecov configuration:

**Scenario A: Codecov action exists but no flags**
```
I found an existing Codecov upload step, but it's not using flags.

Current setup:
[show current codecov action/config]

I recommend adding the `unit-tests` flag to properly categorize your coverage.

Proposed change:
[show updated config with flags: unit-tests]

This allows you to:
- Separate unit test coverage from other test types
- Add integration/e2e coverage later with different flags
- Get clearer coverage reports per test category

Should I apply this change? (yes/no)
```

**Scenario B: Codecov configured only on PR, not on push to main**
```
I found Codecov configured for PRs, but not for pushes to main/master.

⚠️ Important: Codecov needs coverage from your main branch to calculate coverage changes on PRs.
Without main branch coverage, PR coverage comments won't show accurate diff coverage.

I recommend adding coverage upload on push to main as well.

Should I update the workflow to also upload coverage on push to main? (yes/no)
```

**Scenario C: Already fully configured**
```
Your repository already has Codecov configured with:
- ✅ Upload on PRs
- ✅ Upload on push to main
- ✅ Using flags: [list flags]

Is there something specific you'd like to change or improve?
```

### Step 3: Recommend Local Upload First

**Always recommend testing locally before CI configuration:**

```
Before configuring CI, I strongly recommend uploading coverage locally first.

This helps:
✅ Verify coverage generation works correctly
✅ Establish a baseline on your main/master branch (required for PR comparisons!)
✅ Confirm the "unit-tests" flag appears in Codecov UI

Here's how:

1. **Switch to main branch:**
   git checkout main

2. **Generate coverage for your unit tests:**
   [provide language-specific command based on analysis]

3. **Install and run Codecov CLI:**
   # Install
   pip install codecov-cli
   # Or download directly:
   curl -Os https://cli.codecov.io/latest/linux/codecov && chmod +x codecov

   # Upload with unit-tests flag
   codecovcli upload-process \
     --token YOUR_CODECOV_TOKEN \
     --flag unit-tests \
     --file [coverage-file-path] \
     --branch main

4. **Verify in Codecov UI:**
   - Go to https://app.codecov.io
   - Check that coverage appears for your repo
   - Click on "Flags" tab in your repository
   - Click "Enable flag analytics" button to enable flag tracking
   - The "unit-tests" flag should now appear

Have you completed the local upload successfully? (yes/no)
```

Wait for confirmation. If they encounter issues, help troubleshoot (see Troubleshooting section).

### Step 4: Handle Multiple Test Types

If the repository has integration tests that generate coverage without instrumentation:

```
I noticed you may have integration tests in addition to unit tests.

If your integration tests generate coverage data (e.g., they run with coverage flags
and don't require special instrumentation like coverport), you can upload that coverage
too with a different flag.

Options:
1. **Unit tests only (this ticket):** Upload with `--flag unit-tests`
2. **Integration tests too:** Upload with `--flag integration-tests`

For each test type, you'll add a separate upload step in your CI.

Would you like me to configure both unit and integration test coverage uploads? (yes/no)

Note: For e2e tests that require instrumentation (running containerized apps),
see the coverport-integration skill instead.
```

### Step 5: Configure CI Pipeline

Based on the CI system the user specified:

#### Option A: GitHub Actions

Analyze existing workflow files and propose changes:

```
I found your test workflow at: .github/workflows/[filename].yml

I'll propose adding Codecov upload after your test step.

**Changes to .github/workflows/[filename].yml:**
```

```yaml
# Add after your test step
- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
    flags: unit-tests
    files: [coverage-file-path]  # e.g., coverage.out, coverage.xml
    fail_ci_if_error: false
```

```
**Important configuration:**
- Ensure this runs on BOTH pull requests AND push to main/master
- The workflow trigger should include:
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main, master]
    pull_request:
      branches: [main, master]

**Setup required:**
1. Add CODECOV_TOKEN as a repository secret:
   - Go to GitHub → Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: CODECOV_TOKEN
   - Value: [your token from Codecov]

Should I apply this change to your workflow file? (yes/no)
```

#### Option B: OpenShift CI (Prow)

```
For OpenShift CI, I need to see your Prow job configuration.

Please provide the link to your ci-operator config file in the openshift/release repository.

Example: https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/master/ci-operator/config/[org]/[repo]/[filename].yaml

Once you provide the link, I'll analyze how your tests run and suggest the appropriate changes.
```

After user provides the link, analyze and propose:

```
I've reviewed your Prow configuration. Here's what I suggest:

**1. Create a coverage upload script (hack/codecov.sh):**
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Generate coverage report
# Adjust this command for your project's test setup
[detected-or-suggested-test-command-with-coverage]

# Download and run Codecov CLI
curl -Os https://cli.codecov.io/latest/linux/codecov
chmod +x codecov
./codecov upload-process \
  --token "${CODECOV_TOKEN}" \
  --flag unit-tests \
  --file [coverage-file-path]
```

```
**2. Add Makefile target:**
```

```makefile
.PHONY: coverage
coverage:
	hack/codecov.sh
```

```
**3. Add coverage job to your ci-operator config (presubmit - runs on PRs):**
```

```yaml
- as: coverage
  commands: |
    export CODECOV_TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/secret/CODECOV_TOKEN)
    make coverage
  container:
    from: src
  secret:
    mount_path: /tmp/secret
    name: [repo]-codecov-token
```

```
**4. Add postsubmit job (runs on push to main - IMPORTANT for baseline!):**
```

```yaml
- as: publish-coverage
  commands: |
    export CODECOV_TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/secret/CODECOV_TOKEN)
    make coverage
  container:
    from: src
  postsubmit: true
  secret:
    mount_path: /tmp/secret
    name: [repo]-codecov-token
```

```
**5. Secret setup required:**
You'll need to add your Codecov token to the openshift-ci vault.

See: https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/how-tos/adding-a-new-secret-to-ci/

The secret should be named: [repo]-codecov-token
With key: CODECOV_TOKEN

Should I create the hack/codecov.sh script and Makefile target? (yes/no)

Note: The ci-operator config changes need to be made in the openshift/release repository.
I can show you the exact YAML to add, but you'll need to submit a PR there.
```

#### Option C: GitLab CI

Analyze `.gitlab-ci.yml` and propose changes:

```
I found your GitLab CI configuration at: .gitlab-ci.yml

I'll propose adding Codecov upload to your test job.

**Add to your existing test job or create a new job:**
```

```yaml
coverage-upload:
  stage: test
  script:
    # Your existing test command with coverage
    - [test-command-with-coverage]
    # Upload to Codecov
    - pip install codecov-cli
    - codecovcli upload-process --token $CODECOV_TOKEN --flag unit-tests --file [coverage-file-path]
  rules:
    # Run on main branch (for baseline)
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
    # Run on merge requests
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
```

```
**Setup required:**
1. Add CODECOV_TOKEN as a CI/CD variable:
   - Go to GitLab → Repo → Settings → CI/CD → Variables
   - Add variable: CODECOV_TOKEN
   - Mark as "Masked" and "Protected"

Should I apply this change to your .gitlab-ci.yml? (yes/no)
```

### Step 6: Verification Checklist

After making changes, provide verification steps:

```
I've made the proposed changes locally. Here's your verification checklist:

**Immediate verification:**
□ Review the changes I made to ensure they look correct
□ Test coverage generation locally one more time

**After pushing changes:**
□ Commit and push to a branch, open a PR
□ Check CI logs for "Codecov upload successful" or similar message
□ Verify in Codecov UI (https://app.codecov.io):
  - Coverage data appears for your commit
  - "unit-tests" flag is visible in the Flags tab
  - Coverage diff is shown on PR (if main branch baseline exists)

**After merging to main:**
□ Verify postsubmit/push job runs and uploads coverage
□ Future PRs should now show accurate coverage comparisons

If you encounter any issues, let me know and I'll help troubleshoot!
```

### Step 7: Optional codecov.yml Configuration

```
**Optional:** You can add a codecov.yml file to customize Codecov behavior.

**Benefits:**
- Set coverage thresholds and status checks
- Configure PR comment format and layout
- Enable carryforward flags (useful when not all tests run on every commit)
- Prepare for additional flags (e.g., integration-tests, e2e-tests in future)

**Example codecov.yml:**
```

```yaml
codecov:
  require_ci_to_pass: yes

coverage:
  precision: 2
  round: down
  range: "50...100"

flags:
  unit-tests:
    carryforward: true
  integration-tests:
    carryforward: true

comment:
  layout: "reach,diff,flags,files"
  behavior: default
```

```
This is optional - basic coverage reporting works without it.

Would you like me to create a codecov.yml file for your repository? (yes/no)
```

## Coverage Generation by Language

Provide language-specific guidance based on detected language:

### Go

```bash
# Standard Go tests
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# With Ginkgo
ginkgo -v --cover --coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
# Or using go test (also works with Ginkgo)
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
```

**Important:** Target unit test directories, not e2e tests:
```bash
# Good - unit tests
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out ./pkg/... ./internal/... ./cmd/...

# Avoid - e2e tests (use coverport for these)
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out ./test/e2e/...
```

### Python

```bash
pip install pytest-cov
pytest --cov=<package> --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript

```bash
# Jest
jest --coverage --coverageReporters=lcov

# Vitest
vitest run --coverage
```

### Rust

```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo tarpaulin --out Xml
```

### C/C++

```bash
# Compile with coverage
gcc --coverage -o myprogram myprogram.c
# Run tests
./myprogram
# Generate coverage
gcov myprogram.c
# Or use lcov for better output
lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.info
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Upload Fails: "Unable to locate build"

**Cause:** Codecov can't match the upload to a commit/PR.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you're passing the correct branch name: `--branch main`
- For PRs, the branch should be the PR branch, not main
- Check that the commit SHA is correct
- Verify the repository is properly added to Codecov

### Upload Fails: "Token not found" or "Authentication failed"

**Cause:** Missing or incorrect Codecov token.

**Solutions:**
- Verify the token is correctly set in CI secrets
- Check for extra whitespace or newlines in the token
- Try regenerating the token in Codecov UI
- For public repos, tokens may be optional but recommended

### Coverage Report Not Found

**Cause:** The coverage file path is incorrect or file wasn't generated.

**Solutions:**
- Verify the coverage file exists after tests run: `ls -la coverage.out`
- Check the file path matches what you pass to Codecov
- Ensure tests actually ran (check for test failures)
- Verify the coverage format is supported by Codecov

### PR Comments Don't Show Coverage Diff

**Cause:** No baseline coverage on main/master branch.

**Solutions:**
- Upload coverage from main branch first (local upload or CI)
- Ensure postsubmit job runs on push to main
- Wait for the main branch upload to complete before checking PRs
- Check Codecov UI to verify main branch has coverage data

### Flags Not Appearing in Codecov UI

**Cause:** Flag analytics must be enabled manually in Codecov UI.

**Solutions:**
- Go to your repository in Codecov UI
- Click on the "Flags" tab
- Click "Enable flag analytics" button
- After enabling, flags from your uploads will appear
- Verify your upload included `--flag unit-tests` in the command
- Check CI logs for the upload command to confirm flags were passed

### OpenShift CI: Secret Not Found

**Cause:** Codecov token secret not configured in openshift-ci vault.

**Solutions:**
- Follow the secret setup guide: https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/how-tos/adding-a-new-secret-to-ci/
- Verify secret name matches what's in your ci-operator config
- Check the secret has the correct key name (CODECOV_TOKEN)
- Ensure the secret is available to your repository's jobs

### Partial Coverage Data

**Cause:** Not all tests are generating coverage, or coverage files are overwritten.

**Solutions:**
- If running multiple test suites, merge coverage files before upload
- For Go: `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...` runs all at once
- For separate runs, use coverage merge tools
- Verify all test commands include coverage flags

### GitLab CI: Variable Not Available

**Cause:** CI variable not properly configured or protected.

**Solutions:**
- Check variable is set in Settings → CI/CD → Variables
- If variable is "Protected", ensure it's available on your branch
- For MRs from forks, protected variables may not be available
- Consider using masked but not protected for broader access

## Validation

After integration, provide these verification steps:

1. **Local verification:**
   - Generate coverage locally
   - Upload with Codecov CLI
   - Check Codecov UI for data

2. **PR verification:**
   - Open a PR with the CI changes
   - Verify coverage uploads in CI logs
   - Check Codecov comments on PR (may need main baseline first)

3. **Main branch verification:**
   - Merge PR or push to main
   - Verify postsubmit/push job uploads coverage
   - Confirm main branch shows in Codecov UI

4. **Subsequent PR verification:**
   - Open another PR after main has coverage
   - Verify coverage diff appears in PR comments
   - Check flags are properly displayed

## Best Practices

1. **Test locally first** - Always verify coverage generation and upload locally before configuring CI
2. **Establish main baseline** - Upload from main branch first for accurate PR comparisons
3. **Use meaningful flags** - Separate unit-tests, integration-tests, e2e-tests
4. **Ask when unsure** - If file paths or commands are unclear, ask the user
5. **Propose, don't assume** - Show proposed changes and wait for confirmation
6. **Keep existing logic** - Don't break existing test configurations
7. **Document manual steps** - Clearly explain any steps user must do outside the repo (secrets, Codecov UI)

## Summary

This skill helps onboard repositories to Codecov by:
1. Assessing current Codecov setup (if any)
2. Analyzing repository structure and CI configuration
3. Recommending local upload first to establish baseline
4. Handling multiple test types (unit, integration) with flags
5. Configuring the appropriate CI system (GitHub Actions, OpenShift CI, GitLab CI)
6. For OpenShift CI, ensuring postsubmit jobs run for main branch coverage
7. Providing optional codecov.yml configuration
8. Troubleshooting common issues

The result is automated coverage uploads with proper flag categorization, enabling teams to track unit test coverage trends and get coverage feedback on PRs.
