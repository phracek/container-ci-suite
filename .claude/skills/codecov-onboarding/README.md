# Codecov Onboarding Skill - Quick Start Guide

We've added a new AI skill to help you onboard your repository to Codecov for unit test coverage tracking.

**Skill location:** https://github.com/konflux-ci/coverport/blob/main/.claude/skills/codecov-onboarding/SKILL.md

## What It Does

The skill guides you through:
- Setting up Codecov for your repository
- Configuring coverage uploads with the `unit-tests` flag
- Integrating with your CI system (GitHub Actions, OpenShift CI/Prow, or GitLab CI)
- Establishing a main branch baseline for accurate PR coverage diffs

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- ✅ Unit tests already running in your repository
- ✅ A Codecov account (sign up at https://app.codecov.io)
- ✅ Your Codecov upload token ready

## What You're Installing

This guide helps you install an AI skill - a specialized workflow that teaches the AI how to help you onboard repositories to Codecov. Once installed, it will automatically recognize when you're asking about Codecov and use this skill to guide you.
